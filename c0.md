## Javascript Basics

Javascript
- most widely used lanuage in the world
- One of the few lanuages preinstalled on most computers
- Interpreted or Compiled Lanuage?
    - Compiled Code (C, C#, Rust, ...):
        - Source code --> Compiler --> Machine Code (executable) --> Execute program
        - Takes your source code and compiles it which then gives you machine code, your executable. Once done you can run the executable
        - Pros: looks for optimizations in your code to make it run faster (removes code that slows you down)
        - Cons: compiling takes a longer time, but the execution is fast!
    - Interpreted Language (Java, Python, Ruby):
        - Source code --> Interpreter (runs line by line) --> Output
        - Takes your source code and interprets it line by line, outputting accordingly
        - Pros: gets an output very quickly
        - Cons: need to install the interpreter, needs to process code line by line!
    - Javascript is both Interpreted AND Compiled as it is interpreted or compiled based on how long each method would take!
        - Creates a copy of your source code and feeds one copy into an interpreter, and one copy into a compiler
        - If Interpreted takes longer than Compiled, than it uses Compiled and the other way around as well!
